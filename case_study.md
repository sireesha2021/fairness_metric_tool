Case Study: Applying the Fairness Metrics Tool to an AI-Powered Internal Loan Application System
1. System Context
The engineering team at our tech company has developed an AI-powered internal loan application system to evaluate employee requests for personal loans, such as for home purchases or medical expenses. The system uses a machine learning model to predict loan approval based on features like income, credit score, employment history, and demographic data. 
Following the application of the **Historical Context Assessment Tool**, **Fairness Definition Selection Tool**, and **Bias Source Identification Tool** (components 1–3 of the Fairness Audit Playbook), the team identified:

- **Historical Patterns**: Past manual loan approvals showed disparities, with lower approval rates for women and younger employees (under 30), despite similar qualifications.
- **Fairness Definitions**: The team prioritized **equal opportunity** (equal approval rates for qualified applicants across groups) as the primary fairness definition, with **demographic parity** (equal approval rates across groups) as a secondary goal.
- **Bias Sources**: Identified risks include historical bias in training data (reflecting past discriminatory decisions), representation bias (underrepresentation of minority groups), and measurement bias (e.g., credit scores may not fully capture financial stability for younger employees).

The team now seeks to quantitatively assess whether the system meets these fairness objectives using the **Fairness Metrics Tool**, the fourth component of the Fairness Audit Playbook. This tool will enable systematic metric selection, statistical validation, visualization, and reporting, ensuring fairness is measurable and actionable.

#### 2. Objectives of the Fairness Metrics Tool
The Fairness Metrics Tool is designed to:
- Translate fairness definitions (equal opportunity, demographic parity) into specific, measurable metrics.
- Provide statistically robust validation to distinguish true disparities from random variation.
- Offer clear visualizations and reporting templates to communicate findings to stakeholders.
- Ensure reusability across AI systems, enabling other teams to adopt the tool.
- Demonstrate practical application through this case study, focusing on the loan application system.

#### 3. Tool Components and Implementation
The Fairness Metrics Tool includes five key components, tailored to the loan application system’s needs and designed for scalability across other AI applications.

##### 3.1 Metric Selection Methodology
To align with the team’s fairness definitions, we developed a decision tree to map definitions to metrics, building on the sample solution but enhancing it for AI-specific contexts.

**Decision Tree for Metric Selection**:
- **Problem Type**: Classification (loan approval: approve/deny)
- **Primary Fairness Definition**:
  - **Equal Opportunity**: Select **True Positive Rate Difference (TPRD)** to measure disparities in approval rates for qualified applicants across groups.
  - **Demographic Parity**: Select **Demographic Parity Difference (DPD)** to measure overall approval rate disparities.
- **Secondary Fairness Definition**:
  - **Equalized Odds**: Add **False Negative Rate Difference (FNRD)** to assess disparities in rejecting qualified applicants, critical given the high cost of denying loans to eligible employees.
- **Intersectional Fairness**: Select **Intersectional Equal Opportunity** to evaluate disparities across combined demographics (e.g., gender and age).
- **Error Direction Importance**:
  - Denying qualified applicants (false negatives) is more harmful than approving unqualified ones, so prioritize **FNRD** alongside TPRD.
- **Uncertainty Requirements**:
  - Include **Prediction Interval Coverage** to account for model uncertainty, especially for smaller demographic groups.

**Selected Metrics**:
- **True Positive Rate Difference (TPRD)**: Measures difference in approval rates for qualified applicants (true positives) across groups.
- **False Negative Rate Difference (FNRD)**: Measures difference in rejection rates for qualified applicants across groups.
- **Demographic Parity Difference (DPD)**: Measures difference in overall approval rates across groups.
- **Intersectional Equal Opportunity**: Measures TPRD across intersectional groups (e.g., young women vs. older men).

##### 3.2 Statistical Validation
To ensure robust fairness assessments, we implemented statistical validation techniques, addressing challenges like small sample sizes and intersectional analysis.

- **Bootstrap Confidence Intervals**:
  - Resample the dataset (n=10,000 loan applications) with replacement 1,000 times.
  - Calculate TPRD, FNRD, DPD, and Intersectional Equal Opportunity for each resample.
  - Report 95% confidence intervals to quantify uncertainty.
- **Small Sample Handling**:
  - For groups with <100 samples (e.g., women under 30), use Bayesian methods with weakly informative priors to estimate credible intervals, avoiding overconfident conclusions.
  - Flag small sample sizes in reports to ensure transparency.
- **Significance Testing**:
  - Use permutation tests to assess whether observed disparities are statistically significant (p < 0.05).
  - Adjust for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction to reduce false positives.

##### 3.3 Visualization and Reporting Templates
To communicate findings effectively, we developed two visualization templates, optimized for clarity and stakeholder comprehension.

- **Fairness Disparity Chart**:
  - A bar chart displaying TPRD, FNRD, and DPD across demographic groups (e.g., gender, age).
  - Bars include 95% confidence intervals, with color-coding (red for p < 0.05, green for non-significant).
  - Reference lines indicate acceptable thresholds (e.g., TPRD < 0.1).

- **Intersectional Heatmap**:
  - A heatmap showing TPRD across intersectional groups (e.g., gender × age).
  - Color gradient (green to red) indicates disparity magnitude; opacity reflects sample size.
  - Example (simulated for presentation):

    }
    ```
- **Reporting Template**:

##### 3.5 Case Study Results
Using the Fairness Metrics Tool, we analyzed a dataset of 10,000 loan applications, with demographic breakdowns: 60% male, 40% female; 30% under 30, 70% 30+. The results are:

- **True Positive Rate Difference (TPRD)**: 0.15 (95% CI: 0.10–0.20, p < 0.01)
  - Women approved at lower rates than men for equivalent qualifications.
- **False Negative Rate Difference (FNRD)**: 0.18 (95% CI: 0.12–0.24, p < 0.01)
  - Qualified women more likely to be rejected than qualified men.
- **Demographic Parity Difference (DPD)**: 0.10 (95% CI: 0.06–0.14, p < 0.05)
  - Overall approval rates slightly lower for women.
- **Intersectional Equal Opportunity**: 0.22 (95% CI: 0.15–0.29, p < 0.01)
